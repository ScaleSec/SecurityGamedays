# ScaleSec's Security Gameday Repo

This repo contains terraform modules to automate triggering of security events in a realistic manner that you can use in conjunction with your SOC and IR teams to validate your monitoring and response procedures.

Each of the directories here have README's that show you how to use them. Only a basic understanding of Terraform and Cloud IaaS is necessary.
